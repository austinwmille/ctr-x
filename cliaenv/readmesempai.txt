Once upon a time, this folder was an absolute necessity. For some reason I was too stupid to figure out how to get the clipsai package to work at all. I had to manually alter the package scripts to get it to work.

Anyway, it *almost* works on my computer by simply importing clipsai via pip. 

There is still a call in the script to manually import the pyannote.py script from here instead of using the one imported via clipsai. I think it's for a stupid reason.


DONT DEAD OPEN INSIDE is actually *very* useful because it contains ffmpeg and yt-dlp. These are FOSS apps, but I'm keeping them here so that everything can be completely self-contained one day.
